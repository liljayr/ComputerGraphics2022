        Question: Reflect on the theory of affine transformations and view in
        transformations by doing the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                List the transformation matrices that you used in Parts 1 and 2
                (use general expressions rather than concrete numbers).
                [Angel 4.9, 5.3-5.5]
            </li>
            <li>
                For each cube, write down a formula showing how the matrices
                were concatenated to become the current transformation matrix
                (CTM) that was used to transform the vertices in the vertex
                shader. [Angel 4.10-4.11]
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        Answer: Here is an analysis of the original cube from Q1 as well as the other
        three cubes in order:
        <ul>
            <li>
                CTM = viewMatrix * modelViewMatrix
            </li>
            <li>
                CTM = mvMatrix * pMatrix
            </li>
            <li>
                loc = translate(1.5, 0.0, 0.0) <br>
                CTM = mvMatrix * pMatrix
            </li>
            <li>
                loc = translate(-1.5, 0.0, 0.0) <br>
                CTM = mvMatrix * pMatrix * rotate(35)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
